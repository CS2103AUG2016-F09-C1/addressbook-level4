# About Us


We are a team based in the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS). We are working on a Task List Application aimed to allow users to record tasks need to be done and prioritise accordingly. Our work can be found on  [CS2103AUG2016-F09-C1](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-F09-C1/main).
