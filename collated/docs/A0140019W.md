## Design




### Architecture
<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="900"/> <br><br><br>
The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.



`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary.



[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.



The rest of the App consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.




Each of the four components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.




For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="900"/> <br><br><br>




#### Events-Driven nature of the design



The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">




> Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskListChangedEvent` when the Task List data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.



The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">




> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.



The sections below give more details of each component.



### UI component




<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>



**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/ui/Ui.java)




The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.



The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)



The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.




### Logic component




<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>



**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/logic/Logic.java)



1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a tasks) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.



Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>
<img src="images/DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>




### Model component



<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>



**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/model/Model.java)



The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task List data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.




### Storage component



<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>



**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/tasklist/storage/Storage.java)



The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task List data in xml format and read it back.




### Common classes



Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.tasklist.commons` package.

## Commands
> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Items in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Items with `...` after them can have multiple instances.
> * Order of parameters are fixed.


<br>
### Viewing help : `help`
Format: `help`




> Help is also shown if you press <kbd>F1</kbd>

<br>
### Adding a task : `add`
Adds a task to the task list<br>

> Title, details and tags are alphanumeric. Date and time are numeric.
>
> Date and time is in 24hr format : `DDMMYY HHMM`
>
> Tasks can have any number of tags (including 0)
>
> Floating tasks can be added without any date and time




Examples:
* `add CS1020 Tutorial d/many questions e/05102016 1200  t/needhelp`

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`




> The search is case insensitive, the order of the keywords does not matter, only the title, description, date, time and tags are searched and tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).

<br>
### Set storage file location : `storage`
Changing the storage file location. <br>
Format: `storage FILEPATH`




> Task list data are saved in a file called `data\tasklist.xml` in the root folder by default.
>
> The file name must end in `.xml` for it to be acceptable to the program.
>
> `Note`: The previous storage file will be deleted.




Example:
* `storage \folder\file.xml` <br>
  Storage file location has been changed to `\folder\file.xml`.

* `list floating`<br>
  `edit 2 d/new updates e/051016 1200`<br>
  Edits the 2nd floating task in the task list, changing the task description to `new updates` and end date and time to `051016 1200`.
